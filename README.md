***HaCoJo Finder***

* This Project is basically based on Automation on some Sites like **Indeed, MassApply, Hackerearth, RemoteOk, OffCampus4u**

* You all might have experienced that You missed any Good Job Opportunities because You were not much aware at that time.
Or
You might have missed any Hackathon or any Contest.

* So, It will collect all the Important Information from all the sites and will print a table for each and every site.

* It will also make an Excel File including all the Links, Date and Timings.

You might be thinking, why to scrap a lot of websites: -
* Well, For Job Opportunities, Different Jobs are available Like: -
    * On **MassApply**, FAANG Level Companies are there
    * On **RemoteOk**, Some Best Opportunities that are present all over the world are there.
    * On **OffCampus4u**, there are a lot of Offcampus Opportunities available where you can directly apply through the link.
    
* And The Second Main Reason is I am still in my learning phase.
  And It was really fun scrapping all these sites because all have their differnt architecture and Simillarly Way of Scrapping will also be difficult.
  I also tried to do some new things in each and every file like: -
  * In **RemoteOk** I tried to print the different tables.
  * In **Indeed**, I tried to switch between the pages, as for jobs they have made a lot of Pages.
  * In **OffCampus4u**, I tried to extract the link of the career site of the Job by going to each and every link.

* I am still working on some sites, for better learning experience.

* If you want to contribute, **Please Contribute** So We can make it the best product available. :)
